## Development Collaboration and Good Practices

Working with a large number of development teams across many projects and organizations we found that it is useful to collect some of our insights. Some of those are related to AEM, but the majority are related to general purpose frontend development or are just general guidelines on how to collaborate in a team of developers.

You may read some of those items and think that it is generally understood as common sense amongst developers. We agree, and thatâ€™s a great sign that you are ready to work in a collaborative way on AEM projects together with other developers.

Please review https://www.aem.live/docs/dev-collab-and-good-practices for additional information and update this section you may want your developers to follow.

## Customization and Variations | hubblehomes.com 

### Indexing

Adobe Experience Manager offers a way to keep an index of all the published pages in a particular section of your website. This is commonly used to build lists, feeds, and enable search and filtering use cases for your pages.  AEM keeps this index in a spreadsheet and offers access to it using JSON. 

For hubblehomes.com, page-index.xlsx is available in sharepoint and the JSON is exposed at https://main--hubblehomes-com--aemsites.hlx.live/data/page-index.json. 
Furthermore, a news index containing data for all news article is available at https://main--hubblehomes-com--aemsites.hlx.live/news/news-index.json. 
Also, Index definition for hubblehomes.com is available in the github, See helix-query.yaml

In context of Hubble Homes, [Hubble Homes Master Spreadsheet](https://main--hubblehomes-com--aemsites.hlx.live/data/hubblehomes.json) is used to build
- Homepage, Communities, Home Plans, Inventory pages
- Search
- XML feeds

Please review the official documentation around Indexing on AEM Edge delivery services : https://www.aem.live/developer/indexing

### Index Web-workers

We're also using a web worker to query and filter article data (see #65 for discussion). This will improve pages that use the worker by offloading the computationally expensive operation from the main thread. The querying and processing won't block the site's content from loading, and ultimately helps improve LHS.


### Search
Search on Hubble Homes is driven by [Hubble Homes Master Spreadsheet](https://main--hubblehomes-com--aemsites.hlx.live/data/hubblehomes.json). As the Communities, Home Plans, Inventory pages etc are added to the master sheet, new data is available for use across the site. 

`Master sheet need to Previewed and Published for the new results to be available. `

When search term is entered, search handler, looks in hubblehomes.xlsx and displays relavent results.


### Templates

Load CSS and JS specific to a template, allowing for template specific styling and auto-blocking, without intermingling that code into global scripts/styles. 

Note: because the template js is loaded before blocks are loaded, but after sections/blocks are decorated, auto blocking needs to be done with that in mind (that is, build and decorate your blocks, and add them to a section, but do not load them).

Templates such as communities, inventory, locations, home-plans, news-detail etc. are all based on this and js/css code is available in github under /templates. There is a `decorate` function in these templates where you can load elements.


### 3rd Party Integrations

### XML Feeds 
XML feed implementation has 2 different facets:

1. XML feed generator
    ---
    - This is a nodejs application available at .github/xml-feed/generate-xml-feed.js
    - Code relies on node js fs & jsdom api. Dependencies are defined in package.json file available at .github/xml-feed/package.json
    - XML feed is generated and stored within the GitHub and file is available at /admin/aIncludeInZillow/HubbleHomes_zillow_feed.xml
    - Code for XML feed generation can run locally by using the below command:
    
    -  ``` 
        cd .github/xml-feed
        npm install
        node generate-xml-feed.js
2. GitHub Workflow
    ---
    - GitHub workflow is used to trigger RSS feed generation.
    - Workflows are available under .github/workflows directory and XML feed generation is controlled by generate-xml-feed.yaml
   - Workflow can be maually triggered by going to https://github.com/aemsites/hubblehomes-com/actions/workflows/generate-xml-feed.yaml
   - Click on `Run Workflow`
   - Select a branch other than `main`
   - Click `Run Workflow`
   - This will create the XML file under the specified branch.
   - As a next step, a Pull Request needs to be created to merge XML file to the main branch.
